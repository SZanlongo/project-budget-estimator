Administrators have access to the entire functionality of the system. The supplier can place a bid on a project's category, cancel an existing bid, update their company profile, view all open projects, and so forth.
  3. The Staff page is shown to administrators as soon as they log in. The Supplier main page is shown to suppliers when they log in. Through this page, suppliers have access to the functionality they are granted to in the form of links. To see how to run and use the application, go to 3.a.
